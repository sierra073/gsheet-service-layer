    "ideally, evan would review the material and give us the price projection he is comfortable with (he has been asking us for many pieces of analysis to lead to this question, including molly/surafael/jamies projections and now this one from adam). in the absence of his final 10G and 1G projection, i have recommended using \\$ 2500 for 10G and \\$ 890 for 1G.\n",

    "How:\n",
    "first, please review the logic for my projection. i tried to make it something that would appeal to evan. it is located here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R12jdZjNvhG9_4yExXCCIozwX6kZ4Axcs4dXt0y3Efk/edit?disco=AAAADU2fU3g\n",

(evan has not requested adjustment for oversubscription, but an alternative we can try if these numbers are low are oversubscription adjustments). note that these projections may change, so it would be wise to make the cost for 1G and 10G easy to malipulate?\n",
