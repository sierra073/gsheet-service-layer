    "### As of 9/3/2019\n",
    "\n",
    "Updated pivotal card: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168254684\n",
    "\n",
    "Updates:\n",
    "- Updated states: AL, AR, CT, DE, GA (use total IA Spend), ME, NC, ND, NE, RI, SC, SD, UT, WA, WY, WV\n",
    "- update current upstream spend to be overall IA spend\n",
    "- update projected spend to include ISP cost projection\n",
    "- include the following metrics from the draft:\n",
    "    -xx million students on state networks can be quickly upgraded to the 1 Mbps per student goal\n",
    "    -This will upgrade over ## million students and position the nation to connect 99% of our schools to the 1 Mbps per student goal by 202\n",
    "- Chart #: State leadership can make digital learning a reality for ## million students by 2022\n",
    "- [Insert 2 national heat maps showing where states are on 1 Mbps (% of districts or students) in 2019 and in 2022 if all of the above upgrades happen]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Original: \n",
    "\n",
    "ideally, evan would review the material and give us the price projection he is comfortable with (he has been asking us for many pieces of analysis to lead to this question, including molly/surafael/jamies projections and now this one from adam). in the absence of his final 10G and 1G projection, i have recommended using \\$ 2500 for 10G and \\$ 890 for 1G.\n",
    "\n",
    "How:\n",
    "first, please review the logic for my projection. i tried to make it something that would appeal to evan. it is located here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R12jdZjNvhG9_4yExXCCIozwX6kZ4Axcs4dXt0y3Efk/edit?disco=AAAADU2fU3g\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "then calculate, for all state network states, how much would it cost to get the state 1G for all of their districts with <1,000 students, 10G for 1,000-10,000 students? for districts over 10,000 students, however many multiples of 10G get them to their goals? (evan has not requested adjustment for oversubscription, but an alternative we can try if these numbers are low are oversubscription adjustments). note that these projections may change, so it would be wise to make the cost for 1G and 10G easy to malipulate?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### New:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a version of state_networks_projections_1G_10G.ipynb that as flat pricing. That is, all districts, regardless if they are meeting or not meeting 1 Mbps goal will get a pricing of $890 for 1G or $2500 for 10G and how this compares to what they are already spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drive by request:\n",
    "\n",
    "See details for GA and NE. How were these estimates determined? Add upstream cost, and ia total costs for reference\n",
